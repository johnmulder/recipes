# Creme Patissiere Experiment 1

## Ingredients

    4 egg yolks
    1 cup cream
    1/3 cup almond milk, vanilla flavor
    1 tsp vanilla extract
    1/4 cup erythritol (adjust to taste)
    1–2 tbsp xylitol
    1/4 tsp salt
    1 packet gelatin
    1/3 cup sour cream
    2 tbsp butter
    6 drops liquid sweetener (e.g., sucralose)

## Steps (Instant Pot Version)

1. Mix erythritol, xylitol, and salt in a small bowl.
2. Separate egg yolks and whisk with the sweetener mixture until smooth. Continue whisking occasionally to prevent clumping.
3. Set the Instant Pot to "Sauté" mode and heat cream and almond milk until just about to simmer (do not boil).
4. Turn off "Sauté" mode. Slowly ladle a small amount of the hot milk into the egg yolk mixture while whisking constantly to temper the eggs.
5. Pour the tempered egg mixture back into the Instant Pot, set to "Sauté" mode again, and stir constantly until the mixture reaches 175°F and thickens. Look for a "burp" (a large bubble) in the center.
6. Turn off the Instant Pot. Sprinkle gelatin evenly over the hot mixture and whisk thoroughly to dissolve (avoid clumping).
7. Pour the mixture into a flat, plastic wrap-lined pan for rapid cooling.
8. Stir in butter and vanilla extract until smooth. Add sour cream and gently mix until incorporated.
9. Wrap the plastic wrap over the mixture to prevent a skin from forming and refrigerate until set.
10. Optional: Fold in whipped cream, cream cheese, or Greek yogurt before serving for additional texture and flavor variations.
