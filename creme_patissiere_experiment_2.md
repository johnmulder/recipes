# Creme Patissiere Experiment 2

## Ingredients

  4 egg yolks
  3/4 cup cream
  2/3 cup almond milk, vanilla flavor
  1 tsp vanilla extract
  1/8 cup erythritol
  1–2 tbsp xylitol
  1/4 tsp salt
  1/2 packet gelatin
  1/3 cup sour cream
  2 tbsp butter
  5 drops liquid sucralose

## Steps (Instant Pot Version)

1. Mix erythritol, xylitol, and salt in a small bowl.
2. Separate egg yolks and whisk with the sweetener mixture until smooth. Continue whisking occasionally to prevent clumping.
3. Set the Instant Pot to "Sauté" mode and heat cream and almond milk until just about to simmer (do not boil).
4. Quickly remove the pot insert and ladle a small amount of the hot milk into the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly to temper the eggs.
5. Gradually pour the tempered egg mixture back into the Instant Pot while whisking.
6. Return the pot insert and set to "Sauté" mode again. Stir constantly and heat until the mixture reaches 175°F and thickens (approximately 3 minutes).
7. Remove from heat, sprinkle gelatin evenly over the hot mixture, and stir thoroughly to dissolve.
8. Pour the mixture into a flat, plastic wrap-lined pan or tray for rapid cooling.
9. Stir in butter, vanilla extract, and sour cream until fully incorporated.
10. Wrap the plastic over the mixture and refrigerate until set. Serve chilled.
