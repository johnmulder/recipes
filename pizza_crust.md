# Pizza (Jennifer)

Ideally, the mozzarella is shredded at home (otherwise they add starchy powders to keep it from clumping in the bag)

## Preheat

Heat the pizza stone in the oven at 350 or more while mixing up the crust

Start the cast-iron skillet on low as you start getting out ingredients. Dump the mozzarella in the skillet first thing.

## Ingredients

### Crust

- 2 cups shredded low-moisture, part-skim mozzarella (not the good, watery kind)
- One egg
- One cup almond flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp garlic
- Big dash of salt
- Dry herbs to taste. 
- 3-5 Tbsp butter

### Toppings

- Mozzarella (any type)
- Tomato sauce

## Steps

1. Pour thee tomato sauce into a coffee filter in a strainer so that the water part of the sauce will drain off.

2. Mix together flour, powder, garlic, herbs.  After the mozzarella melts, dump on most of the dry mixture.   

3. Break the egg on top of that, and mix egg and flours together. Some of the cheese will mix in.   

4. Add the butter and the rest of the dry. Mix in the skillet with hands into a ball. Don't force all the butter in if it doesn't want to combine.

5. Place on a piece of parchment paper and roll out as flat as possible. this will easily roll out to 15-16 inches round. 

6. Place paper and crust on the pizza stone, which is alreday hot in the oven. Cook at high oven temp for about 5 minutes.  Check often after 3 mins.  When it puffs up, slice open the puffy bits.

7. Flip it over and cook 1-2 minutes more.  It should be mostly cooked as much as you want it cooked the toppings will only be grilled/broiled on the top in a thin layer.

8. Pick the side the toppings will go on (less cooked) and spread the topping mozzarella in a thin layer (to seal the crust from the topping juices). Broil for a few minutes to melt the layer together. Place sauce and toppings on the cheese layer, broil until they get hot.

9. Profit.
