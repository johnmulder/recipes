Creme pat. experiment
4 yolks
1  c cream, 
1/3 c almond milk, vanilla flavor
Tsp vanilla
1/4 c erythritol - TBSP or two
1-2 TBSP of xylitol
1/4 tsp of salt
1 packet gelatin, this was a disaster - some of it probably dissolved
1/3 c sour cream
2 Tbsp butter
6 drops of liquid spends stuff

Mix xylitol, salt, erithrytol together
Separate eggs, dump sweet/salt in the yolks an whisk the dickens out of it
	keep whisking every so often while you do the other stuff so it doesn't clump
Cook milks on medium heat to just a simmer/boil
Take off heat, mix in a couple of ladles of hot milk to the egg yolks
Mix this together. Put milks back on the heat, pour in the yolks.
STir and heat mixture until 175 for a minute or so. A big burp should come out of the middle of the mixture (heat/air bubble).
Pour gelatin on hot mixture and stir.  Don't blob it in, it will congeal.
Pour the mixture into flat pan lined with plastic wrap. Add in butter and vanilla and stir.
Dump in the sour cream and swirl until mixed in.  Wrap up the plastic over the blob and set in the fridge.
