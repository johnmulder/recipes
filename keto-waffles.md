# Keto Waffles

## Ingredients

    75 grams Birch Benders Keto Pancake & Waffle Mix
    1/2 cup water
    14 grams coconut oil
    1 additional tablespoon water

## Tools

- Stick blender
- Mixing bowl
- Spatula
- Waffle iron

## Steps

1. **Prepare Ingredients**:  
   - Measure the mix, water, and coconut oil accurately. Melt the coconut oil if solid.

2. **Mix Batter**:  
   - Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl.  
   - Use a stick blender to blend until smooth, scraping the sides of the bowl as needed.  
   - Do not overmix or prepare the batter more than 5 minutes in advance to preserve air bubbles.

3. **Cook Waffles**:  
   - Preheat the waffle iron and lightly grease it if necessary.  
   - Pour the batter into the waffle iron, ensuring it spreads evenly.  
   - Cook according to the waffle iron's instructions or until waffles are golden brown and cooked through.

4. **Cool and Serve**:  
   - Carefully remove the waffles from the iron and let them cool slightly before serving.  
   - Top with your favorite keto-friendly toppings and enjoy.

## Notes

- The stick blender ensures a smooth batter but scrape the sides periodically to incorporate all dry mix.
- Batter must be used immediately for optimal results; air bubbles will dissipate if left too long.
- For crispier waffles, cook an additional minute in the waffle iron.
