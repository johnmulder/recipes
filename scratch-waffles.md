# Keto Waffles

## Ingredients

    5 oz cream cheese  
    4 eggs  
    1/2 cup almond flour  
    1 tablespoon psyllium husk powder  
    Approx. 1/4 cup almond milk (to thin as needed)  

## Tools

    Mixing bowls (2)  
    Hand mixer or whisk  
    Spatula  
    Waffle iron  

## Steps

1. Set out cold ingredients to warm up to room temperature.  
2. Beat egg whites to soft peaks using a hand mixer or whisk, then set aside in the fridge.  
3. In a separate bowl, beat or stir eggs and cream cheese until smooth.  
4. Combine almond flour, baking powder (if desired), and psyllium husk powder in another bowl. Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the egg and cream cheese mixture.  
5. Add almond milk as needed to thin the batter to a thick pancake batter consistency.  
6. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the batter using a spatula to preserve airiness.  
7. Preheat the waffle iron and lightly grease it if necessary. Pour the batter into the waffle iron and cook according to the manufacturer's instructions.  

## Notes

- Makes about 10 half-round waffles.  
- Two waffles provide a very filling breakfast.  
- Whipping the egg whites helps create a lighter texture but can be skipped for simplicity.
