Keto Cheesecake
---------------

### Ingredients
- 2 bricks of Philadelphia cream cheese 
- lemon (fresh is better, but do what you gotta) - 1 to 2 TBS
- vanilla - 1 tsp
- 3 eggs - get them out of the fridge with the cream cheese to come to room temp
- 1 1/3 C. allulose sugar substitute 
- 2 cups of sour cream	

8 ramekins instead of a springform or cake pan.


### Instructions

No crust, but a nut crust would do quite well I think, the Internet knows about those.

Get the 2 bricks of cream cheese out of the fridge about 4 hours ahead of time (or overnight). Preheat the oven to 250. (You may have to experiment with the oven - ours is 20 years old and we are at high altitude).

Stir the sour cream with the mixer on low for 10-15 seconds

Add the cream cheese and mix on a little higher speed for couple of minutes.

It doesn’t get real smooth.  Who cares.
In a different bowl (or one of those pyrex glass microwave measuring cups) mix the 3 eggs, vanilla, lemon, allulose

Leave the mixer on medium-low and pour in the egg mixture a little bit at a time.  Let the previous egg mix blend in before putting in more. Try to mix the batter for the shortest time you can to get the job done.

Put a baking sheet (with sides) on the oven rack and heat up a kettle of water to pour in it later.
Drop 3 heaping tablespoons of batter into each ramekin. Don’t fill to the top.
Put the ramekins into the baking sheet and pour the kettle into the baking sheet between the ramekins.  The water shouldn’t go more than half-way up the ramekins.

Bake at 250 for 50 minutes, turn the oven off and leave them in there for another hour.
They say you should let it cool completely before it goes in the fridge so you don’t get condensation. We had good luck putting it in right after the hour of oven-off sitting.

The tops don’t brown. The batter has stopped jiggling after the 50 minutes is up.
