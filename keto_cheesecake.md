# Keto Cheesecake

## Ingredients

    2 bricks of Philadelphia cream cheese
    1 to 2 TBS lemon
    1 tsp vanilla
    3 eggs, room temperature
    1 1/3 C. allulose sugar substitute
    2 cups of sour cream

## Tools

- Mixer
- 8 ramekins

## Steps

1. **Prepare for Baking**:  
   - Preheat the oven to 250°F (adjust for your oven and altitude if needed).  
   - If desired, prepare a nut crust or use ramekins without crust.

2. **Soften Cream Cheese**:  
   - Remove cream cheese from the fridge about 4 hours ahead of time (or overnight).

3. **Mix Sour Cream**:  
   - Stir the sour cream with a mixer on low for 10–15 seconds.

4. **Add Cream Cheese**:  
   - Add cream cheese to the mixer and blend at a slightly higher speed for about 2 minutes. The mixture won’t be completely smooth—this is fine.

5. **Prepare Egg Mixture**:  
   - In a separate bowl or microwave-safe measuring cup, mix eggs, vanilla, lemon, and allulose until combined.

6. **Incorporate Eggs**:  
   - With the mixer on medium-low, slowly pour the egg mixture into the cream cheese mixture a little at a time. Allow each addition to blend before adding more. Mix just enough to combine ingredients.

7. **Prepare Baking Setup**:  
   - Place a baking sheet with sides on the oven rack. Heat a kettle of water for later.  

8. **Fill Ramekins**:  
   - Drop 3 heaping tablespoons of batter into each ramekin, leaving space at the top.

9. **Create Water Bath**:  
   - Place the ramekins in the baking sheet and pour hot water into the sheet, filling it to about halfway up the sides of the ramekins.

10. **Bake and Cool**:  
    - Bake at 250°F for 50 minutes.  
    - Turn off the oven and leave the ramekins inside for an additional hour.  

11. **Refrigerate**:  
    - Let the ramekins cool completely before refrigerating to avoid condensation, or refrigerate immediately after the hour-long resting period if needed.

12. **Check Doneness**:  
    - The tops will not brown, and the batter should no longer jiggle after baking.
