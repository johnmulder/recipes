# Creme Patissiere Experiment 3

## Ingredients

    4 egg yolks
    1 cup heavy cream
    1/4 cup mascarpone cheese (optional, for richness)
    1/3 cup sour cream
    2 tbsp unsalted butter
    1/3 cup unsweetened almond milk, vanilla flavor
    1 tsp pure vanilla extract (or seeds from 1 vanilla bean)
    2 tbsp erythritol
    1–2 tbsp xylitol
    5–6 drops liquid sucralose (or adjust to taste)
    1/4 tsp salt
    1/2 packet gelatin (enough for gentle thickening, no clumping)

## Steps

1. **Prepare Sweetener Mix**: Combine erythritol, xylitol, and salt in a small bowl. Adjust sweetness to taste.
2. **Whisk Yolks**: In a separate bowl, whisk egg yolks with the sweetener mix until smooth and pale. Set aside.
3. **Heat Milks**: Set the Instant Pot to "Sauté" mode. Heat heavy cream and almond milk until just below a simmer (do not boil).
4. **Temper Yolks**: Turn off "Sauté" mode. Slowly ladle a small amount of the hot milk into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly to temper the eggs.
5. **Combine and Cook**: Pour the tempered yolk mixture back into the Instant Pot. Set to "Sauté" mode again and stir constantly until the mixture thickens and reaches 175°F. Watch for the signature "burp" (a large bubble) to ensure proper thickening.
6. **Incorporate Gelatin**: Turn off the Instant Pot. Sprinkle gelatin evenly over the hot custard, whisking thoroughly to dissolve without clumping.
7. **Enhance Texture**: Stir in mascarpone cheese (if using), butter, and vanilla extract until smooth.
8. **Cool Down**: Pour the mixture into a plastic wrap-lined flat pan or tray for rapid cooling.
9. **Add Sour Cream**: Once slightly cooled, mix in sour cream for a tangy, creamy finish.
10. **Chill and Serve**: Wrap the plastic wrap over the surface to prevent a skin from forming and refrigerate until set. Serve chilled.

## Notes

- **Mascarpone Addition**: This adds richness and creaminess while maintaining low-carb content.
- **Sweetener Balance**: Use erythritol and xylitol together for a smoother, less grainy sweetness. Adjust liquid sucralose for personal taste.
- **Consistency Tweaks**: Reduce or increase gelatin based on desired thickness. For a lighter texture, fold in whipped cream before serving.
- **Flavor Variations**: Add a pinch of cinnamon or a drop of almond extract for variety.
